# Sabes esse Vine?

## 🎯 Objective
Be the first player to collect **10 points**, with at least **2 points in each category** — *Trivia*, *Act It*, and *Quote It*.  
Relive the iconic Vines, test your memory, your acting chops, and your quoting skills!

## 👥 Players
- **2 to 5 players**, or up to **10 players** if playing in **teams of 2**

## 🃏 Game Components
- Vine Cards
- 6-sided die
- Paper and pen to track scores
- Timekeeping tool (e.g. your smartphone)

## 🎲 Game Setup
1. Shuffle the Vine Cards and place them with the image side faced-up.
2. Each player (or team) receives a score sheet or sets up a shared scoreboard.
3. Determine who goes first by rolling the die — highest roll starts!

## 🔄 Gameplay
On your turn:
1. **Roll the die** (1 to 6).
2. Draw the top card from the deck.
3. You have 30 seconds to complete the challenge based on the number rolled:

| Die Roll | Challenge Type | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 or 2   | 🎓 Trivia       | Answer a question based on the Vine's description. |
| 3 or 4   | 🎭 Act It       | Reenact the Vine scene described on the card. |
| 5 or 6   | 🗣️ Quote It      | Recite the most famous line from the Vine or describe what happens. |

1. The other players (or teams) act as judges and vote if the performance or answer was successful. Simple majority wins the point.
2. If successful, the player/team earns 1 point in that category.

## 🌟 Winning the Game
The first player or team to reach **10 points total** and **at least 2 points in each category** wins the game!
